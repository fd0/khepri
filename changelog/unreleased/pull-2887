Enhancement: Secondary key for locks in B2

We've added options for Backblaze B2 that can prevent restic from permanently
deleting its data. You can now use B2_LOCK_ID and B2_LOCK_KEY, which need to be
able to delete files with a `locks/` prefix. Then, the main B2_ACCOUNT_ID and
B2_ACCOUNT_KEY do not need delete permissions for most operations. For details,
please see the manual.
