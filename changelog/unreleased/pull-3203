Enhancement: Allow to check specific pack files

Restic check used to check either all packfiles or a subset that is chosen
either in a deterministic or random way but did not allow to specify the pack
files to check directly.
This feature is now added. It allows to fine-tune the checking process or support
troubleshooting in case of corrupted repositories.
