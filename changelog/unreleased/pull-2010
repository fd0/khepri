Enhancement: Add support for --prefix and --strip-components options on backup

We've added two options that rewrite target paths upon backup:

--prefix=/foo/bar prepends a relative or absolute path;
--strip-components=n strips n components from target path.

The rationale for these options is to allow different paths to look equal
upon parent snapshot id selection.

For instance, when backing up ZFS snapshots from
<mountpoint>/.zfs/snapshot/<snapshot-id>, user could run restic from
CWD=<mountpoint>/.zfs/snapshot/<snapshot-id> using "." as target, and
pass --prefix=<mountpoint> as option. This way, multiple ZFS snapshots
could be stacked as restic snapshots with correct parent-child relationship.
