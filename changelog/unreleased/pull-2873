Enhancement: Option for root paths in diff command

The diff command now has new `--from-root` and `--to-root` flags that allow you
to compare specific subpaths within snapshots.

This allows you to compare a specific subset of a snapshots, and to compare files in 
snapshots that were taken with different root paths.
