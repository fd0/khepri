Bugfix: Expand environment variables when used in `--files-from` files

Environment variables were not expanded when the file specified using the
`--files-from` option contained any environment variables. This is now changed
such that environment variables are expanded only in files specified using the
`--exclude-file` (or `--iexclude-file`) and the `--files-from` options. The
`--files-from-raw` and `--files-from-verbatim` options remain unaffected by
this change.
