Enhancement: Add new commands --cleanup-index and --cleanup-packs

We've added two new restic commands:
cleanup-index removes blobs that are not used from the index files.
cleanup-packs removes pack files that are not referenced in the index.

With these two comamnds you can do a prune without repacking.
This can be used if prune is too slow or too memory consuming.
