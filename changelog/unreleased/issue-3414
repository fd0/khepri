Enhancement: Add --keep-hourly-within switch to restic forget

restic forget allowed users to specify keeping a given number of 
hourly backups, or to keep all backups within a given interval,
but not both, that is to specify keeping hourly backups within
a given interval.

The --keep-hourly-within switch offers this functionality, and 
parallell switches for daily/weekly/monthly/yearly are also 
implemneted. The new switches are:

  --keep-hourly-within <1y2m3d4h>
  --keep-daily-within <1y2m3d4h>
  --keep-weekly-within <1y2m3d4h>
  --keep-monthly-within <1y2m3d4h>
  --keep-yearly-within <1y2m3d4h>
