Enhancement: Enable admin to decide group access to repository files

Access to all repository directories and files used to be restricted to the
current user only, preventing various use cases where other users should be
allowed to read the repo files.

Now we create files with group access enabled but still blocked by
directories remaining group inacessible by default. This allows admins to
configure directory modes to decide if group access should be allowed going
forward.
