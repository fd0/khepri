Enhancement: expose filerestorer tunning parameters in cmd_restore command

The `restic restore` command now exposes three new flags that control the 
behaviour of the filerestorer.

These new flags are the following:

```
--average-pack-size int    average pack size in bytes (default 5242880)
--files-writer-count int   number of open files for restore (default 32)
--worker-count int        number of workers for file restore (default 8)

```
