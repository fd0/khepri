Enhancement: Add options for warmup-possibilities to prune and reabuild-index

Restic `prune` did not have a good possibility to warm up pack files that need
repacking but are stored in a cold storage backend.
We have added the option `--warm-up`` which just tries to access all needed
files. This triggers a warmup for some cold storages.
Also the option `--json` in combination with `--dry-run` now prints the pack
file names in JSON format. This can be used to implement a custom warm-up.
The `--warm-up` option is also available to `rebuild-index`.
