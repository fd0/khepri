Enhancement: Restore progress UI

Print information about what restore is doing (i.e. creating target directory structure, 
downloading file contents, etc), ETA of completion, and summary of the work done. 
On "dumb" terminals only prints summary by default, but more details are printed in
verbose mode (i.e. -v restic parameter).
